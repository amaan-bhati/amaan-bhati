  A quote that resonates with me is...
  <blockquote>
    “Can I say something? Um, I’m the type of person that if you ask me a question and I don’t know the answer, I’m gonna tell you that I don’t know. But I bet you what, I know how to find the answer and I will find the answer.”
    <br><strong>Chris Gardner interpreted by Will Smith in the movie "Pursuit of Happyness" (2006)</strong>
